		output: `##### Document.subscribe('presence')

This method allows you to subscribe to presence-related changes. You'll be notified whenever clients watch, unwatch, or modify their presence.

The \`initialized\` event occurs when the client list needs to be initialized.
For example, this happens when you first connect a watch stream to a document, when the connection is lost, or when it is reconnected.

<Alert status="warning">
Subscribe before attaching the document to ensure you receive the initial \`initialized\` event.
</Alert>

\`\`\`javascript
const unsubscribe = doc.subscribe('presence', (event) => {{
  if (event.type === 'initialized') {{
    // event.value: Array of users currently participating in the document
  }}

  if (event.type === 'watched') {{
    // event.value: A user has joined the document editing in online
  }}

  if (event.type === 'unwatched') {{
    // event.value: A user has left the document editing
  }}

  if (event.type === 'presence-changed') {{
    // event.value: A user has updated their presence
  }}
}});
\`\`\`

Use \`my-presence\` and \`others\` topics to distinguish between your own events and those of others.

##### Document.subscribe('my-presence')

This method is specifically for subscribing to changes in the presence of the current client that has attached to the document.

The possible event.type are: \`initialized\`, \`presence-changed\`.

\`\`\`javascript
const unsubscribe = doc.subscribe('my-presence', (event) => {{
  // Do something
}});
\`\`\`

##### Document.subscribe('others')

This method enables you to subscribe to changes in the presence of other clients participating in the document.

The possible event.type are: \`watched\`, \`unwatched\`, \`presence-changed\`.

\`\`\`javascript
const unsubscribe = doc.subscribe('others', (event) => {{
  if (event.type === 'watched') {{
    addUser(event.value);
  }}

  if (event.type === 'unwatched') {{
    removeUser(event.value);
  }}

  if (event.type === 'presence-changed') {{
    updateUser(event.value);
  }}
}});
