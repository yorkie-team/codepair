		content: `<!--  Thanks for sending a pull request! -->

#### What this PR does / why we need it?

Change "documents" to "document" in DocEvent 

#### Any background context you want to provide?

There were previous proto changes in the js-sdk, so I have set the target branch to "concurrent-case-handling."

		title: "Add `presence.get()` to get presence value in `doc.update()`",
		content: `<!--  Thanks for sending a pull request! -->

#### What this PR does / why we need it?

The presence value can be obtained using the \`presence.get()\` function within the \`doc.update\` function

\`\`\`js
client.attach(doc, {{
	initialPresence: {{ counter: 0 }},
}});

// as-is
doc.update((root, p) => {{
	const counter = doc.getMyPresence().counter;
	p.set({{ counter: counter + 1 }});
}});

// to-be
doc.update((root, p) => {{
	const counter = p.get('counter');
	p.set({{ counter: counter + 1 }});
}});
\`\`\`

		title: "Support concurrent insertion and splitting in Tree",
		content: `<!--  Thanks for sending a pull request! -->

#### What this PR does / why we need it?
This PR introduces support for concurrent insertion and splitting in the Tree by utilizing \`leftNode.parent\` as the \`parent\` node.

#### Any background context you want to provide?
Currently, the \`parentID\` and \`leftSiblingID\` in \`CRDTTreePos\` represent positions in the Tree. In other words, they help derive the \`parentNode\` and \`leftSiblingNode\` in the Tree.

When splitting an element node, the split node receives a new nodeID (#707). This complicates concurrent editing, particularly when a remote operation, unaware of the node's split, refers to child nodes that were previously in the original node but are now in the split node. In such cases, the local cannot locate the target node because the original node no longer contains those child nodes.

Fortunately, the \`leftNode.parent\` represents the exact parent node in the current tree. Therefore, using this as a \`parent\` effectively addresses the  above problem.

In summary, the \`parentNodeID\` in \`CRDTTreePos\` is now solely used to determine whether the given position is the leftmost. Instead, substantial tree operations utilize \`leftNode.parent\` as the \`parent\`.
