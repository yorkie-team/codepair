		title: "Introduce broadcast API for event sharing",
		issueType: "enhancement üåü",
		content: `<!-- Please only use this template for submitting enhancement requests -->
**What would you like to be added**:
Yorkie presently relies on the Publish-Subscribe model for sharing document and presence events (refer to: [pub-sub.md](https://github.com/yorkie-team/yorkie/blob/main/design/pub-sub.md)).
However, this lacks the capability to extend its scope to encompass additional event types, notably notifications for end users  concerning new document updates or comments.
To address this limitation, the introduction of a "broadcast" feature is recommended.
This feature would enable users to define and share a wider range of general events beyond the existing document and presence events.
It's also related to #442, which extracts \`Room\` from \`Document\` and moves \`Presence\` from \`Client\` to \`Room\`.
**Why is this needed**:
Provide a more comprehensive event-sharing mechanism that satisfies various use cases.`,

**Description**:

Move \`Client.Watch\` inside \`Client.Attach\` and hide it from the external interface.

Go SDK is just used in integration tests of servers without other SDK installations. So it was OK to expose \`Client.Watch\` to the external interface. But by adding more and more features to the SDK, it is quite difficult to keep simple tests.

Let's move Client.Watch inside Client.Attach and hide it from the external interface to maintain consistency with other SDKs and simplify testing.

**Why**:

Keep the product simple`,
